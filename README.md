# Implement---Searching-Algorithms
To study and implement different searching algorithms such as Linear Search and Binary Search using C++.

## Aim 

To understand how searching techniques work to find a specific element from a list or array and compare their efficiency.

## ðŸ“˜ Theory  
Searching is a process used to find the location of a specific element in a collection of data such as an array or list.  
There are two common searching methods:

### **1. Linear Search**
- It checks each element one by one until the required element is found or the list ends.  
- It is simple but not efficient for large datasets.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)

### **2. Binary Search**
- Works only on **sorted arrays**.  
- Repeatedly divides the array into two halves and checks the middle element.  
- Much faster than linear search.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)

| Algorithm | Works On | Speed | Efficiency |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Linear Search | Unsorted or Sorted | Slow | Less Efficient |
| Binary Search | Sorted Only | Fast | More Efficient |

Searching algorithms are used in real-world applications like **databases, dictionaries, and file systems** for quick data retrieval.

## âœ… Conclusion  
In this experiment, we learned how **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** work to find an element in an array.  
Linear Search is easy but slow for large data, while Binary Search is faster but requires sorted input.  
This experiment helped us understand the importance of choosing the right searching method based on data and application type.
